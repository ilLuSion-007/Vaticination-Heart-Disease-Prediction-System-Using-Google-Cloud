# Vaticination-Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-Using-Google-Cloud

Inroduction :

Today, it is frequently seen that many people around us suffer from different diseases, some of them are curable but some of them are not. Some require quick attention but some can be taken in period of time. Heart diseases are the one which require proper attention and need quick treatment. There are systems that can identify the type of disease a person is suffering but still the systems are not precise and the level of correctness is also not met. So, there is a need of reliable, accurate and feasible system to diagnose such diseases in a time.

In our project we are focusing on this issue and are using different types of machine learning algorithm to train and test data-sets using labeled dataset of heart disease and try to find the classifier which predict that result with higher accuracy on out-of-sample data. At the end, we will also perform feature selection on our model to improve the level of accuracy. In client view, we are accepting the user inputs dynamically through suitable executable hosted on our cloud server according to the prerequisites required by the end-client system and catching them into remotely-empowered database and handling that client inputs utilizing trained data-sets for our final prediction and showing them on our centralized web-based interface.

Objectives Achieved :

1)  We found training accuracy for different classifiers. 
2)  We found testing accuracy for our classifiers as well.
3)  We did cross validation to find the best value of 'K' in cross validation for different classifier.
4) We have performed feature selection over the given data set.
5) We have developed a client-side executable file that will sign up user, provide login and input symptoms via remote SQL server.
6) We have trained our model over the google cloud and predicting its output via dynamic user inputs.
7) We are performing all our computation on Jupiter server which is set up on cloud and itâ€™s ipv4 address we have mapped to our domain.
8) We have developed and deployed the GUI using lamp stack for showing each user profile with its symptoms and ease for admin management.
